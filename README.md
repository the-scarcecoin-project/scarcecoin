# ScarceCoin - Scarcity, Simplified.

## Project Summary
- **Max supply:** 21,000
- Provably **1,000 times scarcer than BTC**
- **100% Rug pull proof & distributed in a fair way** (IDO was done on July 3rd, 2021 on SushiSwap at the price of $0.001 per ScarceCoin (ticker symbol SCARCE))
- **Token distribution:** 
  - **SushiSwap IDO:** 20,000 SCARCE
  - **Founding Team:** 1,000 SCARCE
- Started with an aspiration to be a unique **combination of a collectible and a credible store of value**, with the aim of getting universally accepted as a form of collateral in DeFi (as it is uncorrelated to the price of ETH, stablecoins and other DeFi tokens)
- **Sound monetary policy** (hard cap on supply with no dilution, ever)
- No mint function, no admin keys, no treasury, no memes, no token burning, no inflationary rewards, no airdrops, no gimmicks, **no empty promises** and no further official roadmap: **ScarceCoin is a finished product that works as intended**
- **No further founding team involvement** (just like Satoshi did with BTC)
- **Long-term focus:** DeFi collectible and collateral for the next 100+ years
- Sound and credible monetary policy, security and **long-term viability** are ScarceCoin's top priorities
